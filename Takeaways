An assign statement drives a wire (or "net", as it's more formally called) with a value. 
This value can be as complex a function as you want, as long as it's a combinational (i.e., memory-less, with no hidden state) function. 
An assign statement is a continuous assignment because the output is "recomputed" whenever any of its inputs change, forever, much like a simple logic gate.
